# Programms-on-break-statment
#Find all combinations of elements from two lists:
# Stop the loop when the counter reaches 3
# Program to find the first number divisible by 7 in a list
# Using a flag to break out of nested loops
#Add two 3x3 matrices using nested loops:
#Find all pairs (i, j) such that i + j = 10 within a range:
# Find the first pair of numbers (i, j) whose product is greater than 50
# Program to stop when the user enters 'quit'
